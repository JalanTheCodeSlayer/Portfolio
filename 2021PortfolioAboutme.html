	<p id="page">Hi my name is Jalan. I live in NC with my parents and siblings.
				<br>
				My first time writing code was 3 years ago and it was stressful. 
				Imagine coming from an environment where literally nobody in your city has written
				a single line of code. <br>I was ready to give up but the vision is what kept me motivated.
				<br>
				I not only had to teach myself programming and logic but also how to create things.
				<br> 
				It sounds easy until you try to do something useful with the knowledge you've learned.
				<br> 
				Now I can say that im confident in my abilities and ready to find my first Web development job.
